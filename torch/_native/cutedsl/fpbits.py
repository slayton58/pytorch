# CuTeDSL float helpers that need the sign bit itself.
#
# copysign is the whole reason this exists. Two of its inputs defeat arithmetic:
#   * -0.0 compares EQUAL to 0.0, so neither `y < 0` nor `y == 0` distinguishes them
#     (`1/y < 0` catches that one case, and nothing else);
#   * a NaN's sign is invisible to every comparison, since all of them are false.
# And |x| must map -0.0 to +0.0, which `x if x >= 0 else -x` does NOT do: -0.0 >= 0.0 is
# true, so it keeps the negative zero, and the later negation then flips BOTH branches --
# measured as every element's sign inverted in test_copysign's +-0.0/+-inf/nan case.
#
# cute.math.copysign says all of this in one instruction, but raises "Copysign is not
# supported on CTK 12.9" here, and there is no nvvm.copysign to fall back on. So the bits
# are masked directly through arith.bitcast: clear x's sign bit, contribute y's. That is
# exact for every input including both NaN signs, and the bitcasts are free (same register,
# no instruction).
#
# The two masked halves are combined with `+`, NOT `|`, and that is load-bearing. The masks
# are disjoint (bit 63 against bits 0..62), so the two are arithmetically identical -- but
# the `|` spelling is the textbook copysign idiom, and something downstream recognises and
# rewrites it, after which a NaN magnitude comes back with the WRONG sign. Measured: with
# `|`, copysign(nan_f64, -1.0) returned +NaN for a mixed-dtype call (f64 magnitude, f32
# sign, where the sign operand is converted in-kernel) while the same call on two f64
# operands was correct. `+` is not the idiom, is never rewritten, and is right in both.
# The bitcast itself is not at fault -- bitcasting a converted value in isolation gives the
# f64 bits, verified in agent_space/bitcast_extf.py.
