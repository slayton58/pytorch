# CuTeDSL NaN-propagating max / min in one instruction where hardware supports it.
#
# torch's max/min family propagates NaN -- amax, amin, aminmax, maximum, minimum and the
# ord=+-inf norms all return NaN if any input is NaN -- and the obvious way to write that
# costs four instructions:
#
#     b if ((b > a) or (b != b)) else a          # two setp, an or.pred, a selp
#
# and the fully-branched form some traits used costs five. PTX has done the whole thing in
# one instruction since sm_80 (`max.NaN.f32`), and NVVM's MaxOp/MinOp expose the flag as an
# attribute -- but cute.arch.fmax/fmin do not pass it, so this reaches the dialect op the
# way those wrappers do. Verified against torch.maximum / torch.minimum over every
# combination of NaN, +-inf and +-0 (agent_space/maxnan_spike.py).
#
# The candidate difference is the SIGN OF ZERO on a tie: PTX max returns +0 for max(+0, -0)
# where the comparison form returns whichever operand it was handed first. Measured BIT FOR
# BIT against ATen on CUDA over all four +-0 combinations of maximum/minimum/fmax/fmin
# (agent_space/signed_zero_probe.py): ATen agrees with the instruction, because its kernels
# are the same hardware semantics. So there is nothing to trade off. Comparing against
# torch.maximum with these overrides ACTIVE says otherwise -- that is the mismeasurement
# that made it look like a difference at all.
#
# FLOAT32 only. PTX has no NaN-propagating f64 max, and integers have no NaN at all, so
# fp64 keeps the comparison form and the integers use the builtins, which do lower for
# integer SSA values (verified against ATen for int8/int16/uint8/int32/int64). fp16/bf16
# never reach these as themselves -- both the reduction accumulator and the pointwise
# compute type are fp32 -- so they get the fast path too.
#
# `dtype` is optional: the reduction traits pass their accumulator dtype, while the pointwise
# op functions receive only values (their signature is fn(*vals, *consts)), so those let it
# be inferred from the operand. Anything the inference does not recognise falls through to
# the comparison form, which is correct for every dtype.
